# ENN-IB2-with-python
an implementation of the ENN and IB2 algorithms using python

In this repository, you will find a Python program for normalization in a data set and the implementation of the ENN and IB2 in Python. 

This program was created to complete an assignment in Knowledge Discovery from Databases.
I want to inform you that all 3 programs assume that the last point of each data point is the class to which it belongs.
