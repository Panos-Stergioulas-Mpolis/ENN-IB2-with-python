# ENN-IB2-with-python
an implementation of the END and IB2 algorithms using python

In this repository you will find a python program for nomralization in a data set and the implementation of the ENN and IB2 in python. 

This program was created to complete an assignment in the course Knowledge Discovery from Databases.
I would like to inform you that all 3 programs assume that the last point of each data point is the class to which it belongs.
